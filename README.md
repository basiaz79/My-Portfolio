# My-Portfolio

# <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

I am a Junior Quality Assurance Engineer.
My interest in software testing comes from my conviction
that it is important to test in order to create high-quality
products and from my strengths, such as the ability to
analyze and problem solving, attention to detail, and
communication skills.

I have basic knowledge and practical experience in testing SQL, API, HTML, XML, JSON. I have practiced extensively using tools such Testrail, Jira, Qase, Trello, DBeaver, Postman and DevTools. Currently I continue expanding my knowledge into Automation testing.

I am motivated by the prospect of discovering new
technologies, methodologies, and testing techniques to
sharpen my skills. Expanding my knowledge base and
working with a team of like minded individuals where
ideas are shared, challenges are tackled collectively, and
successes are celebrated together

I enjoy working in a team and collaborating with others. I am looking for a company where I could use my skills and become a valuable team member.

If you are looking for a QA Engineer with strong analytical skills, and a passion for creating high-quality products, please feel free to contact me.
